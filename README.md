# Big-Data-Project-AirBnB_Clustering

## Introduction and Problem Statement:

## File Folder Structure:
Most of our files are broken up based on the milestone goals accomplished that particular week
- milestone1 : Contains notebooks on doing EDA for each of our regions: East, Central, and West along with an example joining calendar and listings-detailed tables
- milestone2 : Contains notebooks on resolving misisng values, doing initial feature engineering, conducting EDA on the aggregate 15 cities, and applying the table joins
- milestone3 : Contains notebooks on creating an intiial modeling pipeline via pySpark, creating our finalized feature engineering dataset, and conducting an initial attempt on decision tree & random forest models
- milestone4 : Contains notebooks on all of our baseline & fine-tuned models for various number of features. The models we conducted in this project are decision tree, logisitic regression, and random forest. Our final predicted zero-review results from the random forest model are in this folder as a zipped up parquet file.
